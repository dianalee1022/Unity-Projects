## Lab1
### Description
For Lab1, I created a scene, simulating a simple catapult -- in the shape of a cannon -- and its targets -- in the shape of coins. A user can aim the targets using either keyboard keys or head gaze from Oculus VR device. 

### Credits
The CameraRig used inside the scene is a prefab from Steam VR Plugin which is available on the Unity Asset Store.

2. Press the following keys to move the cannon vent accordingly:
- *Left arrow key* : Left direction
- *Right arrow key* : Right direction
- *Up arrow key* : Lift-up the cannon vent
- *Down arrow key* : Lower the cannon vent
3. Press the *space bar* to fire a bullet toward the target

### Shooting using Oculus Rift
1. Put on the Oculus Rift and start appropriate software including Oculus/SteamVR
2. Aim a target by moving head
3. Once aimed, press the *trigger* on the *right hand controller* to fire a bullet
